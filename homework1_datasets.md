Homework: Choose 3 datasets, describe it and explain why you chose it
dataset 1:
source: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/
The Enron dataset contains a large collection of real emails from the Enron cooperation. It includes columns such as from, to, cc, bcc, date, subject, body, attachments, ...
Unlike most datasets, where names and details are usually anonymized, the Enron emails actually keep the real names. That makes it pretty unique because you get to see actual people involved in real conversations.
Additionally, it’s one of the very few datasets that comes from a real-world case involving corporate crime, so it’s not just random emails, but a snapshot of what was going on behind the scenes during a major scandal. Since the emails were part of a legal investigation, they reveal how evidence is documented and used in corporate fraud cases. As I am working for a law firm, this is particularly interesting to me

dataset 2:
source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores?select=transfers.csv
This dataset contains data regarding transfers of soccer players. It contains columns such as player identifier, the date and season of the transfer, the origin and destination club IDs and names, the transfer fee paid, the player’s estimated market value at the time. As someone very interested in sports in general and in the sports industry, I am curious about this dataset because it allows to compare transfer fees to market values to study over- or under-valued transfers, look at how transfer fees have changed over seasons, analyze peaks in the market, such as inflation, spikes post tournaments (World Cup, European Championship, etc.).\

dataset 3:
source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices
This dataset contains data regarding houses in the State of California. It includes columns such as the latitude and longitude, the number of rooms, the number of bathrooms, median household income, proximity to the Ocean, etc. I would like to move to California after my studies here at Leuphana so it is interesting to me to understand what factors most influence house prices, detect hotspots of high property value, and compare urban vs coastal vs inland housing patterns.
