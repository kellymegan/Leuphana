Hi, I am Megan! I’m passionate about uncovering insights and telling stories through data. My journey into data science began on the golf course — as a scholar-athlete on the Seattle University golf team, I discovered the power of statistics in performance analysis. That experience sparked my interest in using data to make sense of the world, ultimately leading me to pursue a degree in Business Data Analytics and a career in Data Science.

Outside of work, you’ll find me exploring the outdoors or enjoying all kinds of sports, whether I’m playing or cheering from the sidelines.
